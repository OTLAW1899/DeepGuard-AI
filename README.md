DeepGuard AI is a **Streamlit-powered application** designed to detect and analyze AI-generated (deepfake) content across multiple modalities:  
- **Text**  
- **Images**  
- **Audio**  
- **Video**

It uses **machine learning–enhanced detection** methods to evaluate the likelihood that content was AI-generated, giving users a clear and interactive way to verify authenticity.

## Features

- **Multi-modal support**: Analyze text, images, audio, and video.
- **File uploads**: Supports `.txt`, `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.rtf`, `.odt`, common image, audio, and video formats.  
- **Text extraction** from documents (PDF, Word, ODT, TXT).  
- **Interactive UI** with Streamlit.  
- **Real-time analysis progress** with progress bar.  
- **Configurable detection threshold** (decide when content is "likely AI-generated").  
- **Detailed JSON output** of analysis results.
